# Bank-Customer-Churn-Case-Study

<B>Introduction:</B> A Spanish Bank has been collecting the data on multiple facets of customer behavior, active or inactive at beginning and end of a given period, crossbuying of different products as well as demographics. 

  • The data is being collected to understand the customer behavior, particularly their propensity to churn. 

  • The data was pulled from a data warehouse linking various tables. 

  • Each customer was tracked in a 6-month window and his/her transaction information was linked with the product portfolio and demographics.

<B>Business Objectives: </B> 

  • The bank is concerned about avoiding churn; one of the important indicators of churn is the transaction behavior of the customer. 

  • The bank would be interested in first finding out how many customers have turned from active to inactive and how many have turned from inactive to active. 

  • Then, the next step would be to find out if there is any difference between the two profiles; Active to Inactive and Inactive to Active.

  ▪ Conduct Data Quality checks and EDA to report findings. 
  
  ▪ Find a suitable approach to solve the problem. 
  
  ▪ Feature Engineer to create new variables. 
  
  ▪ Generate summaries using a combination of variables that help address the problem.
